ðŸŽ® Video Game Sales and Ratings Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes video game sales and ratings (both critic and user scores) for the top 400 video games released since 1977. Using SQL, I explore trends in sales, critical acclaim, and user ratings to identify the best-selling games and the years when video games were rated the highest.

The project is split into three main tasks:

Best-selling video games: Find the ten games with the highest sales.
Highest average critic score years: Find the ten years with the highest average critic scores, ensuring that each year had at least four games released.
Golden years of gaming: Identify years where both critics and users broadly agreed that games were highly rated, and calculate the difference between critic and user scores.
Goals
Find the best-selling games to understand market trends.
Analyze critic and user scores to identify "golden years" for video games.
Compare critic and user reviews to discover alignment or disagreement between the two groups.# video_games_golden_era
